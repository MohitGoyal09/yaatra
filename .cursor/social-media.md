# Social Media Post Points: "Dharma-Prachar" Feature

## Overview

A gamification feature that rewards users for sharing their seva (service) achievements on social media, creating a positive feedback loop and boosting app virality.

## Impact

- **Boosts app virality** and positive user feedback loop
- **Lets users show-off their actions**, encourages more Seva
- **Increases user engagement** through social proof
- **Builds community** around shared values and achievements

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Trigger Points

Share prompts should appear after high-value actions:

- ‚úÖ Found a missing person
- üèÜ Top 10 leaderboard achievement
- üìÖ Event attended/completed
- üßπ Cleaning task completed
- üíù Donation made
- üéØ Milestone reached (e.g., 100 hours of seva)

### 2. Share Content Generation

**Template System:**

- Pre-formatted templates for different achievement types
- Dynamic content injection (user name, achievement details, points earned)
- Branded visual elements (app logo, colors, fonts)
- Relevant hashtags (#Seva, #Dharma, #Community, #YaatApp)

**Content Formats:**

- **Screenshot generation** for visual posts
- **Styled HTML/CSS** for PWA sharing
- **Text templates** with emojis and formatting
- **Image overlays** with achievement badges

### 3. Sharing Mechanisms

**Primary:** Web Share API (native sharing)
**Fallback:** Copy-to-clipboard with formatted text
**Platform-specific:** Direct links to major platforms (WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook)

### 4. Backend Integration

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/social/share` - Record share event
- `GET /api/social/templates` - Fetch share templates
- `POST /api/points/award` - Award points for sharing

**Database Schema:**

```sql
social_shares (
  id, user_id, achievement_type, platform, 
  shared_at, points_awarded, template_used
)
```

## Prototype Implementation

### Mock Events for Testing

1. **Cleaning Task Completion**

   - Show: Share prompt with cleaning achievement template
   - Test: Web Share API and clipboard fallback

2. **Find Member Simulation**
   - Trigger: User "finds" a mock missing person
   - Show: Share prompt with found person template
   - Test: Points awarding and backend integration

### Demo Flow
